        <h1>Between the Pages</h1>
        <div>
            In a small, forgotten town, Ellie, a quiet librarian, 
            spends her days among old books and dusty shelves,
            her world confined to the pages she loves but never quite touches. 
            Every morning, she notices the same man, Theo,
            a gentle artist, walking past the library window on his way to the café.
            He always stops, his gaze lingering on the books she’s reading,
            as if he’s silently sharing a secret with her. 
            Their worlds orbit each other, but they’ve never exchanged words, 
            both too shy, too afraid of disrupting the fragile balance of their solitude. 
            One rainy afternoon, Ellie finds an old, hand-painted postcard tucked between 
            the pages of a forgotten book—a drawing of the very town square they both walk through. 
            It’s signed, simply, “Theo.”

            Inspired by the postcard, Ellie begins leaving small notes inside books
            she knows he’ll check out, each one a soft invitation to meet, 
            yet she keeps her identity hidden. Weeks pass, and Theo starts to respond—his notes growing bolder, 
            filled with drawings and thoughts of his own. One day, he leaves a note with a drawing of the two of them,
            sitting together under an umbrella, surrounded by rain. Finally, 
            they meet in the café, where neither of them speaks at first,
            but the quiet is comfortable, a shared understanding that
            their love had always been there—woven into the very fabric of the town,
            the books, and the spaces between them. As they leave together, 
            the rain slows to a gentle drizzle, and the world feels smaller,
            yet fuller, as if they’ve always been meant to find each other.
